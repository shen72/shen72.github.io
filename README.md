I am currently a software engineer manager in Waymo, leading Waymo's Scene Understanding team. Previously, I worked for Nuro and Google. I received my PhD degree in Computer Science from University of North Carolina at Charlotte, and Bachelor's degree from Fudan University.

In my spare time, I enjoy photography and sports.
